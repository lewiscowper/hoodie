## Installation

`npm install --save @hoodie/dev-top-level`

_Note: In the future this will be `npm install --save hoodie`, but this is a temporary developer preview name._

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "hoodie"
},
"hoodie": {
  "plugins": [
    "hoodie-plugin-appconfig",
    "hoodie-plugin-email",
    "hoodie-plugin-users"
  ]
}
```

That's it! Running `npm start` will now serve a hoodie-app from your `www` folder.

Run `npm start -- --help` to see more options.

## Why is there no code in this repo?

Hoodie consists of many components that are bundled and tested in this top-level module.

If you want to read or contribute to the source-code you can get to it in the individual repos.

### Core Components

- [**server**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server)
- [**client**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie.js)
- [**admin-dashboard**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-admin-dashboard)

### Core Plugins

- [**plugin-appconfig**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-plugin-appconfig)
- [**plugin-email**](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-plugin-email)

## Development

Please note that you need to run a Selenium Standalone Server if you're running the tests locally. You can download it on the [project's website](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).

`java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.46.0.jar`

Once Selenium is running you can execute `npm test` in another terminal tab.
